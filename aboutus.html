        <p>Ruth Heflin Cofer lived a life of service and love for her community and people of all walks of life. Early
            in her adult life, she and her husband Fred J. Cofer didn’t have much, but through hard work they prospered.
            This enabled Ruth to meet needs as she encountered them. She served as an active volunteer and member of the
            Hamilton County (TN) Nursing Home for 30 years, and served as president for the Nursing Home Auxiliary for a
            total of 17 years. She was a very dedicated Christian who gave God the praise for so many opportunities to
            help those around her, especially the elderly and forgotten, truly living a life following the example of
            Jesus Christ. Ruth and Fred Cofer also were the parents of two physically challenged sons who had cerebral
            palsy. Ruth and Fred worked hard to give their sons all the advantages they could and never limited them in
            anything. Ruth Cofer’s wish was to create a foundation to help other needy, physically challenged children.
        </p>
